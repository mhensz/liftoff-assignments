## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I am an avid crocheter and knitter. I recently put up peg board on my craft room wall so that I could see all my yarn at once.  So often it is sitting in a huge tub where I can't see what I have.  I thought it would be great to be able to know what stock I have no matter where I am.

My project is an app for tracking yarn stashes.  Users will be able to sign in and see their own virtual peg board.  It will store all the information about all their different kinds of yarn including yardage, weight, brand, color, and a box for notes.  Users will also be able to upload a photo of the yarn.  When a project is finished, the user can weigh the yarn that is left and the app will calculate the remaining yardage and update the information.
### Features
User login: Users will create their own account and choose what defaults on their pegboard.

Peg Board: The pegboard will display thumbnails of the yarn the user has already uploaded. The user will be able to swipe through the pages of pegboard to view all their entries.

Autmoatic Yardage Calculation: When yarn is added, the user inputs the yardage and the weight of the skein. The app will calculate the grams/yard. At the end of a project, the user will weigh the leftover yarn and enter it in. The app will calculate how much yardage is left and update the database.
### Technologies
React
JavaScript
Firebase
JSON

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn how to make a React app and components.  This will include how to use states to update a page.  I will also need to learn how to store and retrieve data from a Firebase server. If the project comes together fast enough, I'd like to also learn how to connect a bluetooth scale to the app for easy weight entry.
